# WaveRider

A rhythm-based precision game where you surf along a dynamic waveform generated by music.

## Core Concept

Ride the wave. Stay aligned or take damage. Different biomes introduce unique wave behaviors and obstacles.

## Controls

- **Up/W** - Move up
- **Down/S** - Move down
- **ESC** - Pause

## Gameplay

- Follow the scrolling waveform by moving vertically
- Stay within the safe zone to avoid damage
- Wave reacts to music intensity
- Each biome has unique wave patterns and hazards

## Biomes

1. **Ocean** - Smooth sine waves, occasional tsunami spikes
2. **Volcano** - Sharp sawtooth, sudden eruptions
3. **Ice** - Blocky waves, slippery movement
4. **Storm** - Chaotic waveform, lightning hides the wave
5. **Space** - Synthwave curves, gravity shifts

## Core Systems

- **WaveController** - Generates and scrolls the waveform
- **PlayerController** - Vertical movement and health
- **BiomeManager** - Biome transitions and obstacles
- **AudioManager** - Music sync and audio filters

## Wave Function

```csharp
float WaveY(float x) = amplitude * sin(frequency * x) + noise
```

Player takes damage when `distance > safeZone`

## Scoring

- Alignment accuracy
- Combo multiplier (stay in perfect zone)
- Biome completion bonuses
- No-hit bonus
- Time bonus
